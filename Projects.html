			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I am a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Washington, who
				is enrolled in UW Computer Science & Engineering's
				<a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/prospective_students/bsms/whybsms">5th-year
				MS program</a>. I am very interested in statistical
				machine learning and algorithms, as well as how these techniques can be applied in fascinating areas
				such as computational biology and natural language processing.</p>
				
			<p>Outside of computer science,
				I also have interests in
				transportation planning, map design, geography, and education. I love
				learning new technologies, expanding my knowledge, and solving challenging problems. 
				I also enjoy playing the piano and the clarinet, reading about miscellaneous topics
				on the internet, travelling, and hiking.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
				<b>Note:</b> Information on recent class projects can be found on my <a href="Joshua Fan resume.pdf">r&#233;sum&#233</a>.

				<h3>Checkers</h3>
					<p>I implemented a game of checkers as a Java applet. I made this applet primarily to practice graphics programming and event handling using Java, which were topics that
							were not covered very much in the Introductory Java class I took. I had to come up with an adequate object-oriented organizational
							structure to handle the board and moves.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, due to security restrictions, I am not able to make the game playable online, but here is a screenshot.</p>

				<h3><a href="QuizApp.html">Quiz app </a></h3>
					<p>I am working on a <a href="QuizApp.html">"quiz" app</a> using Javascript/JQuery that allows users to quiz themselves on various topics, under various settings. Although it is functional already, I am still
							working on adding features to the app, such as allowing users to create their own quizzes, and an algorithm that helps users learn the material.</p>

				<h3>Personal website</h3>
					<p>I designed this website mostly from scratch using self-taught web programming skills, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It showcases my projects, interests, and r&#233;sum&#233.</p>

				<h3>Word frequency analyzer/comparator</h3>
					<p>For my data structures class, I created a program (with a partner) that compares word frequencies in given text files to compute a value representing the similarity of two texts.
							This program can be used to predict who wrote a particular text, by comparing its word-frequency "signature" to other texts by the candidate authors.
							This involved implementing and using a variety of data structures (including a self-balancing binary tree, hashtable, a modified form of a linked list, and
							a max-heap) and sorting algorithms (such as merge sort, insertion sort, and heap sort).
