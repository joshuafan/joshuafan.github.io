		<h3>Monitoring Vegetation from Space at Extremely Fine Resolutions via Coarsely Supervised U-Net</h3>
		
		<p><em>Joint work with Di Chen, Jiaming Wen, Ying Sun, Carla Gomes</em></p>
		<img src="imgs/cs-sunet.png" />

		<p>Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a powerful tool to measure plant productivity from space. However, satellites can only measure SIF at a coarse spatial resolution. For example, we only know the average SIF of a 3x3 km tile, and cannot distinguish how individual farms are doing. To address this, we worked with plant scientists to develop Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net (CS-SUNet). CS-SUNet takes in fine-resolution satellite imagery (Landsat), and predicts SIF for each 30m pixel, even though we only have labels at a much coarser resolution (3km). Even though the supervision is extremely weak, the model can produce accurate fine-resolution predictions thanks to strong regularization techniques (smoothness loss, early stopping) that encourage pixels with similar input features to have similar SIF predictions. Our method resolves fine-grained variations in SIF more accurately than existing methods.</p>

		<h3>Interpretable Spatiotemporal Deep Learning for Crop Yield Forecasting </h3>

		<p><em>Joint work with Junwen Bai, Zhiyun Li, Kaitlyn Chen, Ariel-Ortiz Bobea, Carla Gomes</em></p>
		<img src="imgs/cornyield_2012_fractiondeviation.png" />

		<p>Forecasting crop yields accurately is crucial for food security and poverty alleviation. In collaboration with agricultural economists, we have developed deep learning techniques to forecast crop yields for US counties from a complex array of weather, soil, and management data. We use 1D CNNs to model temporal structure, and a “county embedding” and graph neural network to model spatial structure [2]. We have adapted interpretability techniques to temporal data to understand model predictions. Our model performs comparably to the USDA forecast in August and September. We are working on further improvements, such as using hypernetworks to account for spatial heterogeneity in the prediction function, and developing a variant of the Transformer architecture with inductive biases to handle the continuous nature of time series data.</p>

		<h3>Aquaculture pond mapping with deep learning</h3>

		<p><em>Joint work with Laura Greenstreet, Felipe Siqueira Pacheco, Yiwei Bai, Marta Eichemberger Ummus, Carolina Doria, Nathan Oliveira Barros, Bruce R Forsberg, Xiangtao Xu, Alexander Flecker, Carla Gomes. </em></p>
	
		<img src="imgs/fish-pond.png" />

		<p>Ecologists are interested in understanding the environmental impact of aquaculture expansion in the Amazon, yet there is little data on where fish farms are located. I am working with collaborators to create methods to detect fish farms from remote sensing imagery. Since there is little labeled data, I developed contrastive learning methods to leverage large amounts of unlabeled images to learn a better representation of each waterbody. This required designing novel augmentations to deal with multispectral images, emphasize the shape of waterbodies, and remove information from the irrelevant background landscape. Our learned representations significantly improved the model’s ability to generalize to new regions with little data. Some of this work was published in a KDD workshop paper [3], and we are continuing to work on making our methods more robust.</p>

		<h3>Edit Embedding via Reinforcement Learning (with Shunfu Mao)</h3>
		
		<p>The goal of this project was to learn an embedding for edit distance, such that the Hamming distance
		between the two embedded strings approximates the true edit distance between the original strings.
		This embedding would allow clustering by edit distance to be done more efficiently (with applications
		to RNA transcriptome analysis, and protein analysis, and spell checking). We attempted to use 
		Seq2Seq neural networks with attention to first learn an existing edit embedding, and use the
		REINFORCE algorithm to improve it. Unfortunately, initial results were not positive, but I hope
		to revisit this problem.</p>

		<h3>Optimization Algorithms for Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis (with Sumit Mukherjee)</h3>

		<p>During a graduate Machine Learning course, we worked on solving a variant of a matrix factorization problem
		more efficiently to infer cell types from single-cell transcriptomic data. Previous approaches relied on very
		slow optimization procedures, and we sought to improve that. We implemented various online optimization
		algorithms and techniques 
		(such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient, and Adagrad) in Matlab and Python
		to minimize the loss function more efficiently. We compared the convergence rates of these methods and verified
		that the cell archetypes identified were usable for downstream applications such as lineage estimation.</p>

		<h3>Storage and Retrieval of Robotic Laser Range Data in Database Systems (with Kaiyu Zheng)</h3>

		<p>For my graduate Databases course project, Kaiyu Zheng and I implemented a database for laser-range scans
		to allow for efficient content-based querying and retrieval of images. We used the Bag-of-Visual-Words 
		representation to store images as feature vectors, and implemented the Flexible Image Database System
		and Locality Sensitive Hashing techniques to speed up nearest-neighbor search. This could be used to 
		expand image training data sets by inferring labels for unseen images based on similar images.</p>

		<h3>Political Speech Clustering (with Irina Tolkova)</h3>
		<p>For my undergraduate Machine Learning course project, Irina Tolkova and I implemented several document
		clustering techniques, such as K-Means++, bisecting K-Means, and spectral clustering, and applied them 
		on top of tf-idf vectors for 2016 political campaign speeches. These algorithms produced interesting
		and interpretable clusters of speeches by candidates and issues.

		<h3>Contextual Bandits notes (with Lalit Jain, Neeraja Abhyankar, Kunhui Zhang)</h3>
		For an Online and Adaptive Machine Learning course, I worked with two other graduate students and a postdoc

		from that area.

				<!--<h3>Checkers</h3>
					<p>I implemented a game of checkers as a Java applet. I made this applet primarily to practice graphics programming and event handling using Java, which were topics that
							were not covered very much in the Introductory Java class I took. I had to come up with an adequate object-oriented organizational
							structure to handle the board and moves.</p>
					
					<p><em><a href="https://github.com/joshuafan/Checkers-Applet">View source code</a></em></p>
					
					<p>Unfortunately, due to security restrictions, I am not able to make the game playable online, but here is a screenshot.</p>

				<h3><a href="QuizApp.html">Quiz app </a></h3>
					<p>I am working on a <a href="QuizApp.html">"quiz" app</a> using Javascript/JQuery that allows users to quiz themselves on various topics, under various settings. Although it is functional already, I am still
							working on adding features to the app, such as allowing users to create their own quizzes, and an algorithm that helps users learn the material.</p>

				<h3>Personal website</h3>
					<p>I designed this website mostly from scratch using self-taught web programming skills, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It showcases my projects, interests, and r&#233;sum&#233.</p>

				<h3>Word frequency analyzer/comparator</h3>
					<p>For my data structures class, I created a program (with a partner) that compares word frequencies in given text files to compute a value representing the similarity of two texts.
							This program can be used to predict who wrote a particular text, by comparing its word-frequency "signature" to other texts by the candidate authors.
							This involved implementing and using a variety of data structures (including a self-balancing binary tree, hashtable, a modified form of a linked list, and
							a max-heap) and sorting algorithms (such as merge sort, insertion sort, and heap sort).
