		<h2>Projects</h2>
		Here are some projects I have worked on, primarily in classes. For work experience, see my <a href="files/Joshua Fan resume.pdf">resume</a>.
		
		<h3>Edit Embedding via Reinforcement Learning (with Shunfu Mao)</h3>
		
		<p>The goal of this project was to learn an embedding for edit distance, such that the Hamming distance
		between the two embedded strings approximates the true edit distance between the original strings.
		This embedding would allow clustering by edit distance to be done more efficiently (with applications
		to RNA transcriptome analysis, and protein analysis, and spell checking). We attempted to use 
		Seq2Seq neural networks with attention to first learn an existing edit embedding, and use the
		REINFORCE algorithm to improve it. Unfortunately, initial results were not positive, but I hope
		to revisit this problem.</p>

		<h3>Optimization Algorithms for Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis (with Sumit Mukherjee)</h3>

		<p>During a graduate Machine Learning course, we worked on solving a variant of a matrix factorization problem
		more efficiently to infer cell types from single-cell transcriptomic data. Previous approaches relied on very
		slow optimization procedures, and we sought to improve that. We implemented various online optimization
		algorithms and techniques 
		(such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient, and Adagrad) in Matlab and Python
		to minimize the loss function more efficiently. We compared the convergence rates of these methods and verified
		that the cell archetypes identified were usable for downstream applications such as lineage estimation.</p>

		<h3>Storage and Retrieval of Robotic Laser Range Data in Database Systems (with Kaiyu Zheng)</h3>

		<p>For my graduate Databases course project, Kaiyu Zheng and I implemented a database for laser-range scans
		to allow for efficient content-based querying and retrieval of images. We used the Bag-of-Visual-Words 
		representation to store images as feature vectors, and implemented the Flexible Image Database System
		and Locality Sensitive Hashing techniques to speed up nearest-neighbor search. This could be used to 
		expand image training data sets by inferring labels for unseen images based on similar images.</p>

		<h3>Political Speech Clustering (with Irina Tolkova)</h3>
		<p>For my undergraduate Machine Learning course project, Irina Tolkova and I implemented several document
		clustering techniques, such as K-Means++, bisecting K-Means, and spectral clustering, and applied them 
		on top of tf-idf vectors for 2016 political campaign speeches. These algorithms produced interesting
		and interpretable clusters of speeches by candidates and issues.

		<h3>Contextual Bandits notes (with Lalit Jain, Neeraja Abhyankar, Kunhui Zhang)</h3>
		For an Online and Adaptive Machine Learning course, I worked with two other graduate students and a postdoc
		(Lalit Jain) to survey recent research on contextual bandits and create a report synthesizing important results
		from that area.

				<!--<h3>Checkers</h3>
					<p>I implemented a game of checkers as a Java applet. I made this applet primarily to practice graphics programming and event handling using Java, which were topics that
							were not covered very much in the Introductory Java class I took. I had to come up with an adequate object-oriented organizational
							structure to handle the board and moves.</p>
					
					<p><em><a href="https://github.com/joshuafan/Checkers-Applet">View source code</a></em></p>
					
					<p>Unfortunately, due to security restrictions, I am not able to make the game playable online, but here is a screenshot.</p>

				<h3><a href="QuizApp.html">Quiz app </a></h3>
					<p>I am working on a <a href="QuizApp.html">"quiz" app</a> using Javascript/JQuery that allows users to quiz themselves on various topics, under various settings. Although it is functional already, I am still
							working on adding features to the app, such as allowing users to create their own quizzes, and an algorithm that helps users learn the material.</p>

				<h3>Personal website</h3>
					<p>I designed this website mostly from scratch using self-taught web programming skills, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It showcases my projects, interests, and r&#233;sum&#233.</p>

				<h3>Word frequency analyzer/comparator</h3>
					<p>For my data structures class, I created a program (with a partner) that compares word frequencies in given text files to compute a value representing the similarity of two texts.
							This program can be used to predict who wrote a particular text, by comparing its word-frequency "signature" to other texts by the candidate authors.
							This involved implementing and using a variety of data structures (including a self-balancing binary tree, hashtable, a modified form of a linked list, and
							a max-heap) and sorting algorithms (such as merge sort, insertion sort, and heap sort).
