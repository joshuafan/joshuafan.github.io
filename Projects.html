					<h3><a href="Checkers.html">Checkers</a></h3>
						<p>I implemented a game of checkers as a Java applet. I made this applet primarily to practice graphics programming and event handling using Java, which were topics that
								were not covered very much in the Introductory Java class I took. I had to come up with an adequate object-oriented organizational
								structure to handle the board and moves.

					<h3>Personal website</h3>
						<p>I designed this website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This website is still under construction as I continue to teach myself more about web programming. Currently, it 
								illustrates CSS formatting and other basics of HTML/CSS, and some beginning Javascript for "games".

					<h3>Anagram Solver</h3>
						<p>As a class assignment, I used data structures such as maps, lists, and implemented my own data structure (LetterInventory) to find all of the possible words that could be made from a given string.</p>
