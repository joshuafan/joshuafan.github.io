			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Joshua Fan is a junior at the University of Washington in Seattle, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics and geography. In addition to these 
						fields, I am also interested in topics such as transportation planning, environmental issues, map design, and education. I love learning new technologies, 
						expanding my knowledge, and solving challenging problems. 
						I also enjoy playing the piano and the clarinet, reading about miscellaneous topics on the internet, travelling, hiking, and playing tennis.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
				<h3><a href="Checkers.html">Checkers</a></h3>
					<p>I implemented a game of checkers as a Java applet. I made this applet primarily to practice graphics programming and event handling using Java, which were topics that
							were not covered very much in the Introductory Java class I took. I had to come up with an adequate object-oriented organizational
							structure to handle the board and moves.</p>

				<h3><a href="QuizApp.html">Quiz app </a></h3>
					<p>I am working on a <a href="QuizApp.html">"quiz" app</a> using Javascript/JQuery that allows users to quiz themselves on various topics, under various settings. Although it is functional already, I am still
							working on adding features to the app, such as allowing users to create their own quizzes, and an algorithm that helps users learn the material.</p>

				<h3>Personal website</h3>
					<p>I designed this website mostly from scratch using self-taught web programming skills, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It showcases my projects, interests, and r&#233;sum&#233.</p>

				<h3>Word frequency analyzer/comparator</h3>
					<p>For my data structures class, I created a program (with a partner) that compares word frequencies in given text files to compute a value representing the similarity of two texts.
							This program can be used to predict who wrote a particular text, by comparing its word-frequency "signature" to other texts by the candidate authors.
							This involved implementing and using a variety of data structures (including a self-balancing binary tree, hashtable, a modified form of a linked list, and
							a max-heap) and sorting algorithms (such as merge sort, insertion sort, and heap sort).
						
				<h3>Search engine and web server</h3>
					<p>I developed a file search engine in C/C++, as well as a web server to process user queries using the search engine. To speed up query processing, I implemented a hash table in C, and then used
							an inverted-index to pre-process the files to be searched into index files. This involved a fair amount of low-level pointer manipulation.</li>
