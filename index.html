			<p><b>Welcome!</b> I am a fifth-year Computer Science PhD student at Cornell University, where I am advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/gomes/">Carla Gomes</a>
			in the <a href="http://computational-sustainability.cis.cornell.edu/">Computational Sustainability group</a>.
			
			<p>My research focuses on developing <b>machine learning</b> techniques for challenging problems in sustainability and agriculture. 
			
			My work has numerous applications including crop yield forecasting, carbon cycle modeling, vegetation monitoring, and detecting fish farms in the Amazon using satellite imagery. I work with experts in agricultural economics, crop science, plant genetics, and ecology, to develop innovative AI solutions that can benefit their fields. 
			
			Because many real-world problems have <b>limited labeled data</b> or <b>weak supervision</b>, my research aims to overcome this using prior knowledge, such as smoothness constraints, spatio-temporal structure, pretraining from unlabeled data, and scientific (process-based) models. On the computational side, my interests include contrastive/self-supervised representation learning (particularly for satellite images and spatio-temporal data), weakly-supervised learning, models for time-series data (such as Transformers and temporal CNNs), knowledge-guided machine learning, and explainable AI.

			<!--I am interested in developing techniques that can generalize well even when data is scarce, coarse-grained, and contains spatio-temporal correlations. I am also intersted in incorporating prior scientific knowledge into machine learning models, as well as explainable AI. Finally, I am also interested in "AI for Social Good" more broadly, including applications in healthcare, alleviating poverty, and mitigating climate change.-->

			<p>Previously, I completed a BS and MS at the University of Washington. There, I worked with the <a href="https://infotheory.ece.uw.edu/">Information Theory Lab</a>
			(with <a href="https://www.ece.uw.edu/people/sreeram-kannan/">Prof. Sreeram Kannan</a>) on creating
			faster algorithms for cell type discovery and clustering on single cell RNA-seq data. Before that, I was 
			a part of the <a href="http://ictd.cs.washington.edu/">Information 
			and Communication Technology for Development lab</a> (with 
			<a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/anderson">Prof. Richard Anderson</a>),
			where I worked on designing apps for medical data collection
			and diagnosis in low-resource clinics.</p>
			</p>I have completed internships at Facebook (3 times), Docugami (an NLP/document engineering startup, 2 times), and BitTitan,
			where I had the chance to work on fascinating problems in machine learning,
			natural language processing, computer vision, and software engineering.</p>
