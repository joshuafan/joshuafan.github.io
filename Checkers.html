			<h1>Checkers game</h1>
			<p class="attention"><b>Note: you may need to adjust your Java security settings to use this applet (go to Java > Configure Java > Security).</b></p>
			<p>This is an implementation of a game of checkers using Java, including event-handling and graphics/Swing.</p> 
			<h4>Rules</h4>
				<p>Checkers is a board game for two players, "Black" and "Red." Each player starts with 12 pieces, which can ONLY move on the light squares. On his/her turn, each player can move one piece.
						In general, pieces are only allowed to move diagonally forward one square (one square horizontally and then one square vertically)
						into a vacant square. However, if there is a piece of the opposing color in an adjacent diagonal square, a player MUST "jump" over
						that piece if there is an empty square on the other side of that opposing piece. A player must make multiple jumps in one turn if
						possible. (If a player has a choice of jumps, the player may choose any of them.)
				<p>If a piece makes it to the other end of the board, it becomes a "King" (marked with a white circle), which can move or jump either forwards or backwards.</p>
				<p>A player wins when his/her opponent has lost all of their pieces or has no legal moves left.</p>

				<p><em>Note: right now this applet only supports a local 2-player game. In the future, when I learn more about Artificial Intelligence, I may add a computer player.</em></p>
