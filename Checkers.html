			<h2>Checkers game</h2>
			
			<p>This is an implementation of a game of checkers against a primitive AI using Java, including event-handling and graphics/Swing. Check out
			the code on <a href="https://github.com/joshuafan/Checkers-Applet">Github</a>.</p> 
			
			<p class="attention">Unfortunately, Java's security settings may block you from using this applet. To get around this, go to the Java Control Panel (on Windows, search for "Configure Java"),
			go to the security tab, change the security level to "High", and add "joshuafan.github.io" to the exception site list.</p>

				var attributes = {code:'checkersPackage/CheckersApplet.class', width:400, height:520};

			<h4>Rules</h4>
				<p>Checkers is a board game for two players, "Black" and "Red." Each player starts with 12 pieces, which can ONLY move on the light squares. On his/her turn, each player can move one piece.
						In general, pieces are only allowed to move diagonally forward one square (one square horizontally and then one square vertically)
						into a vacant square. However, if there is a piece of the opposing color in an adjacent diagonal square, a player MUST "jump" over
						that piece if there is an empty square on the other side of that opposing piece. A player must make multiple jumps in one turn if
						possible. (If a player has a choice of jumps, the player may choose any of them.)
				<p>If a piece makes it to the other end of the board, it becomes a "King" (marked with a white circle), which can move or jump either forwards or backwards.</p>
				<p>A player wins when his/her opponent has lost all of their pieces or has no legal moves left.</p>

				<p><em>In this game, you are the Black player and the computer is Red. Good luck!</em></p>
