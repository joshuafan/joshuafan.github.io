			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Joshua Fan is a junior at the University of Washington in Seattle, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics and geography. In addition to these 
						fields, I am also interested in topics such as transportation planning, environmental issues, map design, and education. I love learning new technologies, 
						expanding my knowledge, and solving challenging problems. 
						I also enjoy playing the piano and the clarinet, reading about miscellaneous topics on the internet, travelling, hiking, and playing tennis.</p>

			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<h3>Computer science, programming</h3>
				<p>As you might have expected from my major, computer science is a subject that I am extremely passionate about. First of all, the results of computer science have penetrated
				so many aspects of modern life. With computer science, we can now instantly find the fastest route to get to a destination using (say) Google Maps, access unprecedented amounts
				of knowledge quickly over the Internet, and instantaneously communicate with others online. (Needless to say, there are countless other examples.) In addition
				to these numerous applications, however, I find the concepts of computer science to be immensely interesting and beautiful in their own right.</p>
				
				<p>While I still have a lot of exploring to do within the field, I have especially enjoyed
				the theoretical computer science courses I have taken so far, covering topics such as data structures, algorithms, probability, and computational complexity theory. These areas, along with 
				related fields such as machine learning, are the sub-fields of computer science I am most interested in.</p>
				
				<p>Computer programming is also something I enjoy. Even though debugging can certainly be painful at times, I find learning new technologies
				and the general sense of problem-solving inherent within programming to be very fun and rewarding. Currently, I am strongest with back-end programming using high-level
				languages such as Java and C#, but I am always enthusiastic about learning different things as well.</p>
				
			<h3>Transport</h3>
				<p>I'll admit that I have something of an obsession with transportation networks. Whether it's buses, railways, planes, or whatever, a well-designed transport network (particularly one involving
				an intricately-designed <a href="http://www.humantransit.org/2010/12/basics-finding-your-pulse.html">pulse network</a>) can be very beautiful 
				to me. Of course, such a network has clear positive impacts on people's lives. I often enjoy pretending to re-design a transport network for a real location. I also 
				like to follow transport issues; some of my favorite blogs include <a href="http://www.seattletransitblog.com">Seattle
				Transit Blog</a> for analysis of transport issues in Seattle, and <a href="http://www.humantransit.org">Human Transit</a> for an interesting explanation of fundamental transit planning principles applied around
				the world.</p>
			
			<h3>Geography and maps</h3>
				<p>I have been fascinated by geography and maps since a very young age. I've always loved learning about different places, and maps can be a great way to do that. To me, maps  
						can be both beautiful and interesting--check out <a href="http://bigthink.com/articles?blog=strange-maps">Strange Maps blog</a>
						or the <a href="http://transitmaps.tumblr.com/">Transit Maps blog</a> for some maps that I greatly enjoy. In addition, 
						the broader field of geography is extremely interesting to me. There are so many intriguing spatial patterns out there that
						intersect with numerous fields, such as economics and political science. The field of geography has also been greatly influenced
						by the unprecedented amount of data and computational tools available in our era; GIS software, databases, and statistical techniques have 
						contributed to many interesting findings in modern geographic research. I find this to be 
						fascinating, especially since this ties my interests of computer science and geography together.
